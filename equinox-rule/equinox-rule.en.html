<h1><a name='Introduction'>Introduction</a></h1>
<p>
The programs below are meant to analyze the equinox rule used for the
French Revolutionary calendar, as implemented by Nachum Dershowitz
and Edward Reingold in C-Lisp.</p>

<p>
The main question is to determine for how long the functions from CALENDRICA 3.0
give the proper computations for the autumn equinox. I do not aim to
pretend that the authors may have left some bugs in their program.
I just want to give hints to users so they can build their own opinions
and determine whether the functions will be accurate for the next 10 millenia
or only for the next two centuries.</p>

<p>
Yet, I draw your attention to the "NO WARRANTY" clause in the licenses.
I only suggest ideas and explanations. But <em>you</em> build your own
conclusions, under your own responsibility. Neither Dershowitz, nor Reingold,
nor me, nor any person directly or indirectly involved in these texts and programs
can be held responsible for what you do with the texts and programs.

<p>
An astronomical year, or a tropical year, lasts
31&nbsp;556&nbsp;925.9747&nbsp;seconds, that is 365.242198781&nbsp;days (source: my HP-48). This gives
us the average duration of a French Revolutionary year using the equinox rule.
If we subtract the 365 whole days, the remainder is 0.242198781&nbsp;day, or
20&nbsp;925.9747 seconds.
With the arithmetic rule, the French Revolutionary year average duration is
365.24225&nbsp;days, that is 365&nbsp;days plus 20&nbsp;930.4&nbsp;seconds.
On average the Gregorian year lasts 365.2425&nbsp;days, that is 365&nbsp;days plus
20&nbsp;952&nbsp;seconds.</p>

<p>
The astronomical year has 4.4253&nbsp;seconds fewer than the arithmetic French Revolutionary year
and 27.0253&nbsp;seconds fewer than the Gregorian year. We can expect that
compared with the arithmetic French Revolutionary year,
the astronomical year will shift by one day in 19&nbsp;524&nbsp;years and
3197&nbsp;years will be sufficient to shift the astronomical year by one day when
compared with the Gregorian year.
</p>

<h1><a name='Statistical Analysis'>Statistical Analysis</a></h1>
<p>
Since we have been talking about mean durations, we have to work on lists of
years with a sufficient length so we can extract individual durations, compute
average durations and find the trend. To obtain the list, we
run <tt>cmpeq.cl</tt> and we store the output in a text file called, for
example, <tt>test-6000</tt>. The content is:
</p>

<pre>
0   0    1    1 1
1...5....0....5.7
   3 1794 22 22  
   4 1795 23 22 +
   5 1796 22 22  
</pre>
<p>
Columns 1 to 4: French Revolutionary year (with leading zeros replaced by spaces),</p>

<p>
Columns 6 to 9: Gregorian year,</p>

<p>
Columns 11 and 12: day number in September for the 1st Vendémiaire, using the equinox rule,</p>

<p>
Columns 14 and 15: day number in September for the 1st Vendémiaire, using the arithmetic rule,</p>

<p>
Column 17: a character to pinpoint the years when the two rules differ.
</p>

<h2><a name='eqrule∆vnd1eq'><tt>eqrule∆vnd1eq</tt></a></h2>
<p>
Since the data in the file produced by <tt>cmpeq.cl</tt> have a fixed
length and a fixed position, extracting these values is very simple.
</p>

<pre>
∇ V ← eqrule∆vnd1eq FIC
V ← {⍎(⊃⍵)[11 12]} ⎕FIO[49] FIC
∇
</pre>
<h2><a name='eqrule∆vnd1ar'><tt>eqrule∆vnd1ar</tt></a></h2>
<p>
And for the arithmetic rule, it is very simple too:
</p>

<pre>
∇ V ← eqrule∆vnd1ar FIC
V ← {⍎(⊃⍵)[14 15]} ⎕FIO[49] FIC
∇
</pre>
<p>
The only problem is that it works only with GNU-APL and it will fail
with other APL interpreters.
</p>

<h2><a name='Computing the moving averages'>Computing the moving averages</a></h2>
<p>
So we have a vector V with N numeric values and we want to compute moving
averages over any P consecutive values. Obviously, we will obtain N+1-P results.</p>

<p>
As explained elsewhere, we assume that N is 6000 and P is 400.
That gives us 5601 average values.</p>

<p>
The first step is storing the values from V in the following table
(N+1-P lines, P columns):
</p>

<pre>
V[1]      V[2]       V[3]     ... V[P-1]   V[P]
V[2]      V[3]       V[4]     ... V[P]     V[P+1]
V[3]      V[4]       V[5]     ... V[P+1]   V[P+2]
...       ...        ...          ...      ...
V[N-P]    V[N+1-P]   V[N+2-P] ... V[N-2]   V[N-1]
V[N+1-P]  V[N+2-P]   V[N+3-P] ... V[N-1]   V[N]
</pre>
<p>
And then, computing the means is a piece of cake. But how do we build this array?
There are three ways to do it.</p>

<p>
The first way consist in building an array with N+1-P identical lines of N columns:
</p>

<pre>
N ← (⍴V)[1]
T1 ← (P,N) ⍴ V
V[1]      V[2]       V[3]     ... V[N-1]   V[N]
V[1]      V[2]       V[3]     ... V[N-1]   V[N]
V[1]      V[2]       V[3]     ... V[N-1]   V[N]
...       ...        ...          ...      ...
V[1]      V[2]       V[3]     ... V[N-1]   V[N]
V[1]      V[2]       V[3]     ... V[N-1]   V[N]
</pre>
<p>
Then we apply a progressive rotate operation to the lines with one of:
</p>

<pre>
T2 ← (¯1+⍳N+1-P) ⌽ T1
T2 ← (0,⍳N-P)    ⌽ T1
V[1]      V[2]       V[3]     ... V[N-1]       V[N]
V[2]      V[3]       V[4]     ... V[N]         V[1]
V[3]      V[4]       V[5]     ... V[1]         V[2]
...       ...        ...          ...          ...
V[N-P]    V[N+1-P]   V[N+2-P] ... V[N-(2+P)]   V[N-(1+P)]
V[N+1-P]  V[N+2-P]   V[N+3-P] ... V[N-(1+P)]   V[N-P]
</pre>
<p>
And then all we have to do is truncating the array by keeping the first P columns.
The problem is that we need two temporary arrays each with (N+1-P) lines
and N columns. With N=6000 and P=400, this gives a total space of 2 × 5601 × 6000,
or 67212000 values.
</p>

<p>
The second way to build the array consists in using an intermediate array T,
with N+1 columns and N+1-P lines. When this array is filled with the content of
V, the N elements from V fill the first N columns of the first line of T,
leaving the last position T[1;N+1] empty. So V is "rewinded" and "restarted" to
continue filling T and so, V[1] lands into T[1;N+1]. So T[2;1] is fed with V[2].
Then the second line of T is filled with the remainder of V, until T[2;N-1] is
filled with V[N]. So the last two positions are empty. V is once again rewinded,
V[1] lands into T[2;N], V[2] lands into T[2;N+1] and V[3] lands into T[3;1].
This array is:
</p>

<pre>
N ← (⍴V)[1]
T ← ((N+1-P),N+1) ⍴ V
 1         2          3            N-1          N          N+1
V[1]      V[2]       V[3]     ... V[N-1]       V[N]        V[1]
V[2]      V[3]       V[4]     ... V[N]         V[1]        V[2]
V[3]      V[4]       V[5]     ... V[1]         V[2]        V[3]
...       ...        ...          ...          ...
V[N-P]    V[N+1-P]   V[N+2-P] ... V[N-(2+P)]   V[N-(1+P)]  V[N-P]
V[N+1-P]  V[N+2-P]   V[N+3-P] ... V[N-(1+P)]   V[N-P]      V[N+1-P]
</pre>
<p>
So, by the simple trick of adding one column, that is N+1-P values, we get
for nearly free the progressive rotation and we use one intermediate array
instead of two.</p>

<p>
But we can do even better. The progressive rotation pattern that exist when
looking at lines in succession can also be found when looking at columns in
succession. Therefore, the third way consists in building an array with N+1
columns and only P lines instead of N+1-P. Then this array is truncated to N+1-P
columns instead of P. And the last step consists in transposing the array to get
the final array that we were waiting for, with N+1-P lines and P columns. Of
course, we have two intermediate arrays instead of just one, but if we suppose
that P is less than N÷3, their total size is lower than the size of the
intermediate array of method 2. Here are both intermediate arrays:
</p>

<pre>
N ← (⍴V)[1]
T1 ← (P,N+1) ⍴ V
 1         2          3            N-1          N          N+1
V[1]      V[2]       V[3]     ... V[N-1]       V[N]        V[1]
V[2]      V[3]       V[4]     ... V[N]         V[1]        V[2]
V[3]      V[4]       V[5]     ... V[1]         V[2]        V[3]
...       ...        ...          ...          ...
V[P-1]    V[P]       V[P+1]   ... V[P-3]       V[P-2]      V[P-1]
V[P]      V[P+1]     V[P+2]   ... V[P-2]       V[P-1]      V[P]
</pre>
<p>
And then
</p>

<pre>
T2 ← (P,N+1-P) ↑ T1
 1         2          3            N-(P+1)      N-P        N+1-P
V[1]      V[2]       V[3]     ... V[N-(P+1)]   V[N-P]      V[N+1-P]
V[2]      V[3]       V[4]     ... V[N-P]       V[N+1-P]    V[N+2-P]
V[3]      V[4]       V[5]     ... V[N+1-P]     V[N+2-P]    V[N+3-P]
...       ...        ...          ...          ...
V[P-1]    V[P]       V[P+1]   ... V[N-3]       V[N-2]      V[N-1]
V[P]      V[P+1]     V[P+2]   ... V[N-2]       V[N-1]      V[N]
T ← ⍉ T2
 1         2          3            P-1      P
V[1]      V[2]       V[3]     ... V[P-1]   V[P]
V[2]      V[3]       V[4]     ... V[P]     V[P+1]
V[3]      V[4]       V[5]     ... V[P+1]   V[P+2]
...       ...        ...          ...      ...
V[N-P]    V[N+1-P]   V[N+2-P] ... V[N-2]   V[N-1]
V[N+1-P]  V[N+2-P]   V[N+3-P] ... V[N-1]   V[N]
</pre>
<p>
This will be the method we will use. Actually no. Because the array:
</p>

<pre>
V[1]      V[2]       V[3]     ... V[P-1]   V[P]
V[2]      V[3]       V[4]     ... V[P]     V[P+1]

V[N+1-P]  V[N+2-P]   V[N+3-P] ... V[N-1]   V[N]
</pre>
<p>
is not the final step of the computation. The final step of the computation is
the vector of moving averages and this vector can be computed from the previous
intermediate array, the one before transposition. Instead of computing the sums
by lines with "<tt>+/</tt>", we will compute the sums by columns with
"<tt>+⌿</tt>".
</p>

<h2><a name='eqrule∆movingav'><tt>eqrule∆movingav</tt></a></h2>
<p>
In the end, the function is:
</p>

<pre>
∇ R ← P eqrule∆movingav V;N;T
N ← (⍴V)[1]
T ← (P,N+1-P) ↑ (P,N+1) ⍴ V

To improve the readability of the computed values, it is better to print them
as a 10-column array, with on the left margin the number of the decade (note:
decade = 10-year span, this is not the French "<i>décade</i>", which means a
10-day span). Beware, this number is not the year number with the unit digit
removed (except is this digit is "0"). This is the same question as the fact
that the XXth century spans from 1901 to 2000 and the XXIth century begins in
2001.

<h2><a name='Usage'>Usage</a></h2>
<p>
To analyse the equinox rule, we use a list of "1 Vendémiaire" over 6000 years,
with a moving average over 400 years.</p>

<p>
Why 6000 years? When I wrote the
<a href='https://github.com/jforget/Pascal-French-Revolutionary-Calendar'>Pascal program</a>
for the French Revolutionary Calendar, I compiled a 6000-year list of "1 Vendémiaire"
and inserted into the program. So I use the same value for the analysis. I admit
this is an artificial value.</p>

<p>
Why 400 years? In the Gregorian calendar, the leap year rule is periodic over
400 years. In the arithmetic French Revolutionary Calendar, we can consider
that the leap year rule is periodic over 400 years, with a glitch every 4000
years. Therefore, the conversion between Gregorian and French Revolutionary is
periodic over 400 years with a glitch every 4000 years. The moving average of
the "Vnd1" vector is constant from year 1 to year 3600, then it decreases a
little from 3601 to 4000 and then it is again constant. For the equinox
version, there will be fluctuations in the moving average, even if much smaller
than fluctuations in the raw values. And there will be a slow shift of 1 day
over 3197 or 4000 years.</p>

<p>
With:
</p>

<pre>
VA ← 400 eqrule∆movingav eqrule∆vnd1ar 'test-6000'
eqrule∆fmt VA
</pre>
<p>

 we see that, as expected, the moving average is a constant 22.4 at first,
 then from 3601 to 4000 it decreases by 1 day and from 4000 on, it stabilise
 at 21.4.</p>

<p>
 If we go on with:
</p>

<pre>
VE ← 400 eqrule∆movingav eqrule∆vnd1eq 'test-6000'
eqrule∆fmt 22.4 - VE
</pre>
<p>
we see that the shift is 1 day after just 1625 years or so and that after 3197
years, its value reaches 2.8 days. The equinox algorithm does not last this
long. Maybe I should do the same experiment with version 4 of CALENDRICA.</p>

<p>
We can also check the drift between the arithmetic rule and the equinox rule
with:
</p>

<pre>
eqrule∆fmt VA - VE
</pre>
<p>
the conclusion is the same.
</p>

<h2><a name='eqrule∆vnd1th'><tt>eqrule∆vnd1th</tt></a></h2>
<p>
As we have seen, the equinox algorithm is not valid over six millenia, but
with the computations I have executed, I cannot really tell when the validity
ends. To determine the (approximate) moment when the algorithm is no longer
valid, I compute a "theoretical 1st Vendémiaire", based on the fact that the
astronomical year and the Gregorian year diverge at the rate of one day in
3197 years. And I also use a previous computation, so the moving average for
the first 400 yers will be similar for the theoretical values computed by this
function and the real values computed by <tt>cmpeq.cl</tt>. All
numbers are computed with 4 digits after the decimal point, because all
previous computations have resulted in numbers with no more than 4 digits
after the decimal point.
</p>

<pre>
∇ V ← eqrule∆vnd1th N
V ← (⌊226600 - (¯1 + ⍳N) × 10000 ÷ 3197) ÷ 10000
∇
</pre>
<p>
And then, we can subtract there theoretical 1st Vendémiaire from those
computed by the equinox rule and determine when the difference, or the moving
average of the differences, is no longer small enough. So we compute:
</p>

<pre>
vt ← eqrule∆vnd1th 6000
mt ← 400 eqrule∆movingav vt
me ← 400 eqrule∆movingav eqrule∆vnd1eq 'test-6000'
⎕PW ← 150
eqrule∆fmt mt - me

According to GNU-APL's documentation, we can plot diagrams with the vectors
computed in our APL programs with the <tt>⎕PLOT</tt> function. This does not work
with the APL interpreter on my computer (downloaded from an Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic
Beaver repo). Maybe I should download the sources for GNU-APL and compile a new
interpreter with all the interesting options. Meanwhile, here is a shell script
to run gnuplot and plot a diagram showing how the 1st Vendémiaire drift year
after year, computed with either the equinox rule or the arithmetic rule.

This script is called with a parameter giving the name of the file where the
output of <tt>cmpeq.cl</tt> (with no APL process). The result is not very
readable.

We do the same type of plotting but instead of the yearly values of the 1st
Vendémiaire, we use the moving average values. To the astronomical moving
average and the arithmetic moving average, we add the linear function which is
meant to give the overall look of the plot.

Just as <tt>⎕PLOT</tt> does not work on my computer, writing files
with <tt>⎕FIO[56]</tt> does not work either. So I write file with the usual
Unix method, piping the standard output.

<h2><a name='Conclusion'>Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>
As we can see on the generated plot, the curve of the <tt>cmpeq.cl</tt> results
and the linear theoretical curve are tangent at first, but they diverge very
soon. That means that errors are more and more frequent as time goes by. We will
adopt a 1000-year threshold for the equinox computations, while keeping in mind
that errors happen before this threshold. The real meaning of this
rule-of-the-thumb threshold is the limit when the errors are too much frequent.
