This repository contains utility programs
for the various French Revolutionary programs
I am interested in. Unless specified otherwise,
the programs are licensed under the same terms
as Perl: the GPL license (version 1 or later)
or the Artistic license.

Installation
------------

A common prerequisite for all programs is
that you must install Perl 5.10 or a later 
version, and the modules F<DateTime> and
F<DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary>.
If a specific program needs more, it will
be written in the program's documentation.
Use C<perlpod> I<program-name> and look
at the I<DEPENDENCIES> paragraph.

gen-tests
---------

This program generates a few test files
for various French Revolutionary calendar
programs. In some cases, the generated file
is a ready-to-use program. In other cases,
the generated files contains lines
that must be copied-pasted into an external
source file.

gen-lisp
--------

This program generates the list of feasts in
the French Revolutionary calendar, for
inclusion in Emacs' cal-french.el program.
