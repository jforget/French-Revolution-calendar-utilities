=head1 Presentation

This repository contains utility programs
for the various French Revolutionary programs
I am interested in. Unless specified otherwise,
the programs are licensed under the same terms
as Perl: the GPL license (version 1 or later)
or the Artistic license.

=head1 Installation

A common prerequisite for all Perl programs is
that you must install Perl 5.10 or a later 
version, and the modules F<DateTime> and
F<DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary>.
If a specific program needs more, it will
be written in the program's documentation.
Use C<perlpod> I<program-name> and look
at the I<DEPENDENCIES> paragraph.

As for C-Lisp programs, a prerequisite is the
installation of F<calendrica-3.0.cl>. See the
comments inside the source files.

=head1 gen-tests

This program generates a few test files
for various French Revolutionary calendar
programs. In some cases, the generated file
is a ready-to-use program. In other cases,
the generated files contains lines
that must be copied-pasted into an external
source file.

=head1 gen-astro-tests

This program generates  test files for the  Pascal conversion program,
the first program to include the equinox astronomical rule in addition
to Romme's arithmetic rule. The  files generated by this program allow
testing each year for a 6 millenia span.

=head1 gen-feasts

This program generates the list of feasts in
the French Revolutionary calendar, for
inclusion in Emacs' cal-french.el program
or in other programs.

=head1 gen-astro-code

This program generates some Pascal code to give the conversion between
Gregorian  and  French  Revolutionary   calendars  using  the  equinox
astronomical rule. The conversion  is pre-computed, instead of reusing
all the functions from F<calendrica-3.0.cl>.

=head1 conv.cl

Script converting Gregorian dates into French Revolutionary,
using the equinox rule, even after the date when Romme's arithmetic
rule was supposed to be in effect.

=head1 conv1.cl

Script converting French Revolutionary dates into Gregorian, using the
equinox rule,  even after  the date when  Romme's arithmetic  rule was
supposed to be in effect.

=head1 cmpeq.cl

Script computing the 1st Vend√©miaire using both rules for some
number of years, to show how the rules compare to each other.
